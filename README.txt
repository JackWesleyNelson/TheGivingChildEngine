TheGivingChild git repository

Use Gradle to import LibGDX_Generate folder into the various Eclipse projects.

Put any assets in the android assets folder.

All modified code goes into the core project, gradle pushes these changes to the other projects.

DO NOT PUSH ANYTHING IN YOUR ECLIPSE_WORKSPACE
ONLY PUSH THE CHANGES THAT ARE MADE TO LIBGDX_Generate

When pulling, make sure to reimport the project folders using gradle.

This should keep $PATH variable issues from arising.
